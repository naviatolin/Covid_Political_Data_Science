    x = "Date",
    y = "7 Day Average of New Cases per 100k people",
    color = "Vote in 2016"
  ) +
  theme_common()
```

**Observations**

- Initially there were more new cases per day in democratic states
- New cases spiked for both democratic and republican states towards the end of June, however new cases spiked by significantly more in Republican states
- There have been more new cases per day in republican states(when compared to democratic state) since Mid June
- As of right now(mid-october) there are apprx 35k new cases per day in republican states and 22k new cases per day in democratic states, and new cases are spiking in both groups

**Notes**

- State Party(Vote in 2016) is calculated by summing all dem vs gop votes in a state(data comes as county based votes) and then if more gop votes the state is republican and if more dem votes the state is democratic
- New cases were calculated by taking the case count for a certain date in a county and subtracting the case count from the previous date using lag()
- the rolling 7 day average was calculated by summing the new cases for the past 7 days and then dividing by 7
- the 7 day average of per cases per 100k people was calculated by grouping by state party, summing the rolling 7 day average for all counties in either democratic of republican states and dividing the the population of all the (dem or gop) states combined

  ) +
  theme_common()
```

**Observations**

- Initially there were more cases in democratic states
- Covid cases in republican states increased rapidly in late June/early July and surpased the number of cases in democratic states

**Notes**
- Normalized based on 100k people
- Each line represents the total cases in all democratic or in all republican voted states

    x = "Date",
    y = "Total Covid Deaths per 100k people",
    color = "Vote in 2016"
  ) +
  theme_common()
```

**Observations**

- Deaths in Democratic states were initially high
- Total deaths in republican states have yet to pass total deaths in democratic states, but are on track to catch up now
- Even though case count shifted in early July deaths are only close to catching up now, implications?!?

**Notes**
- Normalized based on 100k people
- Each line represents the total cases in all democratic or in all republican voted states

    ) +

  theme(
    aspect.ratio = 5/7
  )
```
**Notes**
- Vote classification
  - Democratic if more votes for clinton in 2016, republican if more votes for trump in 2016
  - Strong(for either category) if clinton/trump split was 15% or greater
- Each dot represents the case count in different counties
- Total covid cases per 100k by county is calculated by county cases/ county population * 100k
